# Infosys Springboard Internship 5.0

This repository contains all the projects done under Infosys speringboard Internship showcasing the implimentation of LLM. It includes Creating Dataset, using API for impliment LLM locally , model management, and creating documentation.
## Internship Structure

### Milestone 1
Tack done during Milestone 1:
#### Creating Dataset
- `artifiacts/`: Contains datasets used in the project and Contains the machine learning models, including base and derived classes.
- `src/`: Contains scripts for running experiments, training models, and evaluating performance.


## Setting Up the Project with MLflow


Ensure all project dependencies are installed by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments and Managing Models 

To run experiments and manage models , execute the script Data_ingestion.py within the `src/` directory:

```
python src/Data_ungestion.py
```
To run the maodel in localhost, execute the scriptt app.py 
```
python app.py
```
This script demonstrates the lifecycle of a Machine Learning project, including initializing an experiment, logging parameters, metrics, and models, and tracking experiments using modular coding practices.
